# This example simulates the Rayleigh Taylor Instability.
# Heavier, smaller particles are placed on top of lighter, larger particles.
# Over the course of the simulation, the particle types switch position.
#
# This has been shown to result in "interesting" auto-tuning.
# There is no guarentee that this will always occur.
#
# This is the setup which has been show to result in "interesting" auto-tuning:
# - Commit: a53d2bc. As AutoPas develops, relative performances can change.
# - Compiler gcc 13.2.0
# - Computer: HSUper. Features compute nodes with 2 Intel Icelake sockets, each with a Intel(R) Xeon (R) Platinum 8360Y Processor with 36 cores. Relative performances can change depending on machine. 
# - MPI/OpenMP Setup: 2 nodes, each with 2 MPI ranks, each with 36 OpenMP processes.
#
# This leads to 4 ranks stacked up on top of each other, each with their own AutoPas container.
# With the above setup, the bottom three ranks always use LC_C08_SoA_N3Enabled.
# The bottom two switch from CSF 1 to 0.5 as their large particles are replaced by smaller particles. (More particles per volume)
# The rank above switches the other way.
# The top rank follows less of a pattern, but frequently chooses some VLC algorithm.
