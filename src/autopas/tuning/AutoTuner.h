 * so-called tuning phase. During a tuning phase, for each Configuration, multiple measurements can be taken,
 * which are called samples. To reduce noise, the samples for one configuration are then condensed to one value for
 * the current tuning phase, called evidence. The evidences are handed on to a tuningStrategy, which selects a) what
 * Configuration to test next and b) which configuration is the best in this tuning phase.
 * If it should not look for a new optimum it is not in a tuning phase.
