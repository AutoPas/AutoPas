/**
 * In every tuning phase, this strategy makes a prediction about the run time for every configuration.
 * Then only those are tested which have the best predictions. In the end, the configuration
 * that performed best during testing is selected.
 *
 * Predictions about run time are extrapolations from previous measurements. There are multiple
 * extrapolation methods available. Depending on this choice a certain number of tuning phases is
 * necessary where everything is tested.
 *
 * Additional features:
 * - Retesting of old configurations: Configurations are guaranteed to be retested after a given amount
 *   of tuning phases so that their predictions do not rely on data points that are too old.
 *
 * The strategy works by having multiple sets of configurations (e.g. the whole search space, optimal
 * search space, search space of configurations that were not tested for a long time). _currentConfig is
 * a iterator to any of them and might be switched between the sets depending on what is currently tested.
