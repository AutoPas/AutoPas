/**
 * A tuning strategy that uses information collected live from the domain to exclude configurations that knowingly
 * perform worse than other configurations in the current simulation state. The remaining configurations are tested
 * consecutively.
 *
 * This "knowledge" is encoded as rules in a rule file. The rules are defined by the user in a domain specific language,
 * formally described in RuleLanguage.g4, which is parsed by the RuleBasedProgramParser with the help of antlr4.
 * The rules are dynamically loaded and executed as a program for the RuleVM in the beginning of each tuning phase.
 *
 *
 * <b>Summary of the Rule Language:</b>
 *
 * The heart of this language are so called configuration orders. Here is one example:
 * ```
 * [container="LinkedCells", dataLayout="SoA", newton3="enabled"] >= [container="LinkedCells", dataLayout="AoS",
 * newton3="enabled"] with same traversal;
 * ```
 * This is a rule that states that *all* configurations that match the pattern to the left of `>=` are better than *all*
 * configurations that match the pattern to the right, provided they have the same `traversal`. The pattern to the left
 * e.g. matches all configuration with container type `LinkedCells`, data layout `SoA` and newton3 enabled.
 *
 * If we want to have this same rule with another container type, e.g. `LinkedCellsReferences`, we can combine these two
 * using a `define_list` statement and use that as container type in the rule:
 *
 * ```
 * define_list LinkedCellsContainer = "LinkedCells", "LinkedCellsReferences";
 * [container=LinkedCellsContainer, dataLayout="SoA", newton3="enabled"] >= [container="LinkedCells", dataLayout="AoS",
 * newton3="enabled"] with same traversal;
 * ```
 *
 * Because always applying the same configuration orders would not be very interesting, we can apply them conditionally.
 * For this, all live info collected in the LiveInfo class is available as a variable in the rule program. One example
 * is `numParticles`. Now let us define a rule which disables all `SoA` configurations if there are only very few
 * particles, because their `AoS` counterpart is better:
 *
 * ```
 * define lowNumParticlesThreshold = 500;
 * if numParticles < lowNumParticlesThreshold:
 *    [dataLayout="AoS"] >= [dataLayout="SoA"] with same container, newton3, traversal, loadEstimator;
 * endif
 * ```
 * At first, we define our threshold as a variable. Variables are always constant and have global visibility. Then, we
 * check if the threshold is not surpassed, and if yes, we apply the configuration order.
 *
 * A larger example file is stored in /examples/md-flexible/input/tuningRules.rule.
 *
 * Additionally, the class supports a so called "verify mode" where full search is performed and the given rules are
 * checked for correctness.
