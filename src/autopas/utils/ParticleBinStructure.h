 * Particle-counting bin structure. Stores all relevant information about the bins and a counter per bin. Provides a
 * particle counting function and can return statistics based on the particle count. Assumes all bins are of the same
 * shape.
 *
 * Expected use order:
 * 1) Constructed
 * 2) Particles counted
 * 3) Statistics calculated
 * 4) Statistics can be extracted from getters
 *
 * A flag ensures (4) cannot be done before (3) and that if particles are added to the count after (3), (3) must be
 * called again before (4).
 *
 * The purpose of this is to calculate all statistics together because it is rather trivial and efficient but provides
 * getters for individual statistics in case some are not desired.
