Introduction
============
This example demonstrates the constraint processing layer.  This
plug-in takes constraints from the user in the form of tuning variable
interdependencies.  For example, if "x" and "y" are tuning variables
for a given session, the following would be valid constraints:

    x <= y
    x + y < 5

Prerequisites
=============
This processing layer requires The Omega Calculator.  It is part of
the Omega Project, which can be downloaded at the following URL:

    https://github.com/davewathaverford/the-omega-project/

Building
========

This directory doesn't directly supply a testing binary.  Instead, it
relies on the client_api example to be successfully built.  Then, the
client_api binary is directed to load the constraint layer along with
the provided constraint file (constraint.in).

The supporting binary from the example/client_api directory can be
built from the current directory (example/constraint) using the
following command:

	$ make all

Running
=======
The constraint specification file provided for this example
(constraint.in) references three of the six total tuning variables,
(param_1, param_2, and param_3).  The example can be launched with the
following command:

        $ make test

Modify the constraint file to see how it affects the tuning session!
