Introduction
============
This directory contains sample applications that use Active Harmony's
Client API to enable run-time auto-tuning support.  The same sample
application is written in multiple languages to provide a specific
example in each language we support.

For now, only a C example is available.  We expect to add support for
Fortran in the near future.

Building
========
The build process will perform a check to ensure compilers exist
before attempting to build an example for any given language.  So, the
following command can be used to build all examples a system supports:

    $ make all

Running
=======
By default, these example programs will attempt to spawn a dedicated
tuning process at launch time.  This requires the HARMONY_HOME
environment variable to be set correctly.  It should contain the full
path to where Active Harmony has been installed.

If HARMONY_HOME is set correctly, simply invoking the program name
will begin a simple tuning example.

    $ ./minimal

To run in server mode, you can use the HARMONY_HOST and HARMONY_PORT
environment variables:

    $ HARMONY_HOST=h.server.org HARMONY_PORT=2012 ./minimal

See the top-level README file for details.
